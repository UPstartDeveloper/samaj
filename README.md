# Samaj

Implementing classic machine learning algorithms from scratch with NumPy, for interview prep (and fun).

Fun fact: "samaj" is a transliteration of the word for "understanding" in Urdu!

## How to Run Locally

For best results, use Python 3.9.
Please use `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.

## What's Included Here

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - see the `analysis` package.
1. **Linear/Polynomial Regression** - see the `models.supervised.regression.linear` module.
1. For supervised models that use backprop: we have `monitor.py`, to **record the learning curves**.
